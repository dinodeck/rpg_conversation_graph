# Conversation Graph

This repository contains two projects that demonstrate how to add Western style conversation graphs to the Japanese style RPG made for the [How to Make an RPG book](http://howtomakeanrpg.com/).

There are two projects.

These projects are dicussed in depth on the How to Make an RPG site here. (URL awaiting article to be published)

Both projects are based on how I assume Never Winter Nights handles conversation graphs.

## NWN Dialog

The basic Never Winter Nights dialog project. This takes the final example from the How to Make an RPG book and adds:

1. Dialog UI
2. Dialog transitions and triggers
3. Basic conversation graph
4. Dialog State to run the conversation graph

You can find more information on the How to Make an RPG webpage here. (URL awaiting article to published)

## NWN Dialog Advanced

This project builds on the first but adds more advanced features. These include:

1. Conditional Nodes
2. Chained NPC dialog (to allow for monologues)
3. Conversation Loops
4. Local Variables

More details about the implementation of this system are available here. (URL awaiting article to published)
